              <li>I know at this point, I've been pretty clear how pretty you are and how you make me feel a certain way *wink* and damn am I so thankful Facebook snitched out your account lol. Anyways, stay pretty baby! I mean this with every organ of my body, you are fucking beautiful and I love every feature of your face and your body. Honestly if I ever get my hands on you, I might not have the willpower to ever let go.</li>

I haven't really worked hard enough to earn that level of trust yet you make me feel like I'm great, good-looking and better than I probably really am! For this I appreciate you so much.

I love your insights into things we talk about even if its dumb shit or makabuluhang shit or whatever. I can really tell that you're a smart, well-read and interesting person and to be honest, there is no one else in the world I'd rather spend my evenings with when I could spend those eveneings with you.</li>

              <p>On the 29th of August, 2024. I met this girl from Reddit. I ignored her at first but decided to message her anyway the next day. This epiphany changed my life forever...</p>

                <p>Across the next few days, I got to know you better. I learned so much about you, your hometown and how alike and different we are. Of course, as much as we liked each other's company- we still had our disagreements. I still remember this fight and at the time it felt awful! I was afraid I'd lost you and you'd just stop talking to me since we weren't long time friends... thankful, now it's just a funny memory. </p>

                <p>Suddenly, by accident, you accidentally leaked a very personal piece of information. As annoying as it was and as stressful it was to reassure you I wouldn't stalk you (I didn't), it turned out to be a fortunate event! Without this, we wouldn't know each other as well as we do now and at in retrospect, I am glad that this happened! </p>

But at some point you showed me so much love and affection that I just said, "fuck it, I'll write you a poem". I thought you were beautiful the moment I laid my eyes on you and I still do to this very moment. And I will to my last breath. </p>

              <h3>To My Beloved Sheila</h3>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <p>Hi baby, this is your special day! I'm so glad I'm here to share it with you. First off, each second with you is worth an hour with anyone else, there is literally no other
                person in this universe I would rather spend each second of my living existence with than you. From the moment we met, I've always enjoyed your company. You always say that we
                have different sense of humor and if that's true then one of the biggest anomaly of my life must be why I love spending every second of it with you. I seriously don't understand hehe.
                However what I do understand is that you're one of my most, if not the most, favorite person to spend time with! I want to talk to you, spend time with you, play games with you,
                learn languages with you, dream with you, fantasize a life together with you and many more.
                
              </br></br>You're also the most beautiful person I know. I know you'll say this is "bola" or whatever, but there is just no other way to phrase it. Every part of your body that I've seen,
                every inch of it, your skin, your body, your face, hair, eyes, teeth, lips, cheeks, all of it, I love every single bit! In the words of The Ridleys, I swear to Zeus, you're 
                Aphrodite in disguise. But you're not just Aphrodite, you have the kindness of Hestia, the loyalty and dedication of Hera, you're independent like Artemis, smart like Athena though you also seem
                to love to drink like Dionysus T^T. Anyways, I love you inside and outside!</p>

              To the future, I promise I'll try to be more mindful of you and be there when you overthink and doubt stuff. I know there have been times when I'm very oblivious to these things
                and times when I fail to communicate how I feel, whether it's frustration or anger or annoyed, and I promise to work on these. I want to understand you better so I can be a way better 
                friends *cough* *cough* to you. I love spending every second with you and every time, I want to treasure you, baby you and love you. I want to make you feel special and not just some
                random person cause you're not. I know you've never been in a relationship so I wanna help you feel what it's like to be loved and to have someone who treasures you more than anyone
                else. I want to be your first everything!

              </br></br>In the future, I want you to be the first person I see when I open my eyes in the morning and the last person I see when I close them at night. I know this is very forward but I'm
                working on it. I have plans for the both of us as well and it may take years to happen and it's only been a month but as I've always said, I will put in the effort to show you how much you
                mean to me. I love you baby, I hope you enjoy this special day and I hope on your next birthday, I'm not "just a friend" ðŸ™ˆ. :P

            </br></br>

            Adding this after our fight earlier :P. </br></br>
            Somber Nights</br></br>

            If you need time</br>
            I'll give you mine</br>
            If you need space</br>
            I'll give you the universe</br>
          </br>
            If you want me</br>
            I'd be happy</br>
            If you don't</br>
            I'll wait for years</br>
